**Customer Behavior**

The key element to get to understand our customers is the way in which we get along with our
own data. Therefore, being a detective is part of our job. This means that you need to
understand the data that you are working with – both from a technical and a business
perspective.

One of the most important communication methods that help you get a direct opinion about
your product/services/company are surveys. The issue is that one Survey won’t really help you
with making decisions, therefore you need to see the bigger picture with multiple surveys.
Assignment
You have been provided with a file – “customer_rating.xlsx” – which has a specific formatting
for some of its values. As a bit of context, you have the following columns:

  •**“TIMESTAMP”** – the time when the rating was given, expressed as a unix timestamp
  
  • **“ISSUE_RESOLVED_ENUM”** – status of the issue at the time of the survey
  
  • **“SURVEY_TYPE”** – the type of contact
  
  • **Product types (4x)** – type of products the customer has (HINT: think about how many
product types does one customer have)

  • **“REGION”** – the region from where the customer is from
  
  • **“CUSTOMER_SCORE”** – the rating from the customer
  
The main idea of this exercise is to see how you deal with the data in the first phase. Without
giving too much away, the current format of the data is not too pleasant to work with. Think
about what must be changed and put yourself in the shoes of a manager – what would you
want to find out?
Two words are very important to keep in mind – cause and effect. Basically, think outside the
box.

Additionally, keep in mind that not everyone around you knows how to code. Therefore, you
cannot show up to a meeting where you present your findings with chunks of code. Prepare a
short presentation with your findings where you make everything clear for everyone. For this
part, be creative (but use PowerPoint, no other presentation software is allowed).
We would also like to find out the following:

- Which dates brought the highest average score? What about the lowest average
score? Can you investigate any correlations?

- Overall, how does the score distribution look like?

- Does the survey type affect the score given?

Anything insightful that you can find out from the data is welcomed – if you can apply anything
that you have learned during your studies, you are more than welcome to use it and show it to
us!


Please solve this exercise with any tool that you are familiar with (Python, R, SPSS, etc.) and
prepare a presentation using PowerPoint. We would also kindly ask you to disclose any usage
of LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) using a comment next to the code generated in your
file. Also, please do NOT copy the entire assignment into ChatGPT and wait for a solution –
we really want to see your way of thinking.
We are looking forward to your presentation!
